## Java.lang.Thread
**what are threads in java**
* In java, a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
* Threads allow multiple tasks to be performed concurrently within a single program, enabling better utilization of system resources and improved responsiveness.
* Each thread represents an independent sequence of instructions that can execute in parallel with other threads.
**What is multi-threading**
  * Multithreading is the concurrent execution of multiple threads in a single process. Each thread represents an independent flow of execution, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently.
  * Creating threads: in java, you can create threads by either extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. Implementing Runnable is generally preferred as it provides separation of concerns.
